abstract = {A natural generalization of the ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic) process introduced in Engle (1982) to allow for past conditional variances in the current conditional variance equation is proposed. Stationarity conditions and autocorrelation structure for this new class of parametric models are derived. Maximum likelihood estimation and testing are also considered. Finally an empirical example relating to the uncertainty of the inflation rate is presented.}

abstract = {In this paper we consider a modification of the classical ARCH models introduced by Engle (1982). In this modified model the conditional standard deviation is a piecewise linear function of past values of the white noise. This specific form allows different reactions of the volatility to different signs of the lagged errors. Stationarity conditions are derived. Maximum likelihood and least squares estimation are also considered. Finally an empirical example relating to the French CAC stock index is presented and several specifications are compared}
